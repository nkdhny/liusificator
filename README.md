# liusificator

Fimware for arduino based massage robot

Works with two servos as manipulators, supports three basic modes

* neutral mode, device is powered but noop
* gauge mode, is used to set angle for servos (massage strength)
* operating mode

You choose mode by clicking buttons attached to pins 0, 2, 3 respectively (TODO, why pin 1 is not working in PULLUP_INPUT mode).
